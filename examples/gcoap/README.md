# gCoAP Example

This application provides command line access to a GNRC implementation of CoAP. 
See the [CoAP spec][1] for background.

We provide two flavors of Makefile for this example:

* `Makefile` -- native networking
* `Makefile.slip` -- SLIP-based border router

See README-slip.md for details on setup of the SLIP flavor.
